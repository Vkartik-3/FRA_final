## Processing Steps
Data were received from the NCSBE. Data were pivoted and then renamed to the column structure used in the file. Data were queried to federal, statewide, and state legislative contests.

Data were joined with the shapefile as noted above. Data from Wake and Henderson counties were used in addition to this shape to join with the election results.

After joining the precincts to their boundaries, the files were checked for precinct-district splits. Ultimately, the precinct boundary and election result files are split across four different files. The "_all_" file contains all the election results joined to precinct boundaries, but does not account for the various precinct-district splits identified in processing and as such, does not contain district assignments. The "_cong_", "_sldl_", and "_sldu_" files contain Congressional, State House and State Senate results at the most granular units for which data is available. Please note that in order to minimize superfluous splits, precinct splits are only made when a precinct contains votes for candidates in multiple districts, as such district assignments for precincts many not perfectly correspond to the districts themselves, particularly in large, uninhabited areas.

In one of case, votes appear in a contest in which no portion of the precinct is contained within the district. These votes are removed from the split, "_cong_" file and the totals will not exactly match. These differences are: 2 votes for GCON13DPIE in GRANVILLE-:-EAOX. None of these votes are not removed from the "_all_" file. 

## Additional Notes

North Carolina provides "sorted" and "unsorted" results - one file where absentee and one-stop votes are assigned to the correct precincts, with noise then injected for anonymity, and one where no noise is injected, but those results are reported at the county-level. For this file we combined the two - using the sorted for counties impacted and unsorted for non-impacted counties.
